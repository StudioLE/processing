# Interactive Visual Experiments

A series of interactive visual experiments written in [Processing](https://www.processing.org/) and ported to [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) to run in the browser.

## Responsive Circles

A grid of circles that change in sizes dependant upon mouse position with decreasing colour values along each axis.

- [Demo](https://rawgit.com/StudioLE/processing/master/responsive-circles/index.html)
- [P5.js source](https://github.com/StudioLE/processing/blob/master/responsive-circles/p5js/responsive-circles.js)
- [Processing source](https://github.com/StudioLE/processing/tree/master/responsive-circles/processing)

## 3D Particle Import

Create a 3D graph of particle data exported from RealFlow. This script makes use of Processing features that are not supported by P5.js so only a java demonstrations are available.

## Responsive Squares

An infinite series of squares that rotate based on mouse position.
